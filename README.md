## A Note For Devs

This is developed in `Next.js`. The build for the static website is in the branch named `deploy` and served directly from that branch.

While using `Next.js` to build a static website served using GitHub Pages, the issues I encountered are
documented [here](https://github.com/sony-mathew/sony-mathew.github.io/blob/master/site/ISSUES.md).
