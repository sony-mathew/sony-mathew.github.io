Follow my journey from writing custom scripts to embracing no-code solutions like Postman flows, and discover how automation transformed my daily management responsibilities. This evolution not only saved countless hours but also improved team efficiency, showing how modern automation tools can free managers from repetitive tasks to focus on strategic leadership.

As a manager, I've learned that success often lies not just in making big strategic decisions, but in efficiently handling the numerous small, recurring tasks that fill our daily schedules. Over the years, I've evolved my approach to automation, moving from custom scripts to modern no-code solutions like Postman flows, and I want to share my journey and insights.

# The Hidden Time Drain of Recurring Tasks

Every manager knows the drill: weekly SLA reviews, scheduling on-call rotations, creating tickets from customer feedback, sending regular notifications, and managing team schedules. Each task might take only 15-30 minutes, but when you add them up across weeks and months, they consume a significant portion of your productive time. More importantly, these manual interventions introduce delays and potential human errors into processes that could be streamlined.

# My Automation Journey

### Phase 1: Custom Scripts and Servers
Like many technically-inclined managers, I started my automation journey with what I knew best: writing custom scripts. In those early days, I'd spend evenings crafting Python and Bash scripts to handle repetitive tasks, hosting them on my own servers. While it was gratifying to see my code in action, managing this setup became a job in itself. I found myself spending precious hours maintaining servers, debugging unexpected issues, and updating code when APIs changed. The solution worked, but it felt like building a house on shifting sand – effective but requiring constant attention to keep it from crumbling.

## Phase 2: Google Sheets and Apps Script
A breakthrough came when I discovered the power of combining Google Sheets with Apps Script. This revelation changed everything. Instead of managing servers, I could store my data in spreadsheets and write simple scripts that anyone on my team could understand and modify. The beauty of this approach lay in its simplicity – team members could view the data in familiar spreadsheet format, while automation quietly worked in the background. This combination served as a perfect middle ground, offering both visibility and automation without the infrastructure headaches of my previous setup.

## Phase 3: Modern No-Code Solutions with Postman Flows
Today, my automation strategy has evolved to embrace the power of no-code platforms, particularly Postman flows. This transition feels like stepping into the future – what once required pages of code and hours of maintenance now takes minutes to set up through a visual interface. I can create complex workflows by connecting different services, all without writing a single line of code. The best part? These solutions are often free for most use cases, and when I need to hand over responsibilities or collaborate with team members, they can easily understand and modify the workflows. It's democratized automation in a way I never thought possible during my early days of server management.

# Real-World Applications

Let me share some practical examples of how automation has transformed my daily management responsibilities. These stories might resonate with your own experiences and hopefully inspire some ideas for your automation journey.

## Taming the SLA Beast
One of my persistent challenges was keeping track of service level agreements (SLAs). In the past, I'd spend hours each week combing through data, sending reminders, and compiling reports. Now, I have a workflow that continuously monitors response times and automatically alerts team members when we're approaching critical thresholds. Every Monday morning, a comprehensive compliance report lands in my inbox, giving me a clear picture of our performance without the manual number-crunching. This automation has not only saved time but has also helped us catch potential SLA breaches before they occur.

## Bringing Peace to On-Call Rotations
Managing on-call schedules used to be a recurring headache. Team members would forget their shifts, time zones would cause confusion, and last-minute changes would create chaos. Through automation, this process has become nearly invisible. The system now handles rotation changes automatically, sends personalized reminders to upcoming on-call engineers, and even synchronizes with everyone's calendars. When someone needs to swap shifts, the workflow manages the updates and notifications, ensuring everyone stays informed without my direct intervention.

This is one of the most impactful automation I have done.


## Making Customer Feedback Work Harder
Perhaps the most impactful automation has been in handling customer feedback. Previously, valuable customer insights would sometimes get lost in the noise of daily operations. Today, our automated workflow constantly monitors feedback channels, identifying key patterns through tag analysis. When certain criteria are met – whether it's multiple reports of the same issue or feedback about critical features – tickets are automatically created and routed to the appropriate teams. What's particularly valuable is how this system generates trend reports that help us spot emerging patterns in customer satisfaction, allowing us to be proactive rather than reactive in addressing user needs.

# Benefits Beyond Time Savings

While time efficiency is the most obvious benefit, automation has brought several other advantages:

- **Consistency**: Automated processes follow the same steps every time, reducing errors
- **Documentation**: Workflows serve as living documentation of our processes
- **Scalability**: As the team grows, automated processes scale without additional overhead
- **Focus**: Less time on repetitive tasks means more time for strategic work
- **Team Satisfaction**: Reduced manual overhead leads to happier team members

# Tips for Getting Started

If you're looking to start your automation journey:

1. **Start Small**: Pick one recurring task that takes significant time
2. **Document the Process**: Before automating, document each step in detail
3. **Choose the Right Tool**: Modern no-code platforms like Postman flows are often sufficient
4. **Iterate**: Start with basic automation and enhance it based on needs
5. **Share Knowledge**: Document your automations and share with the team

# Conclusion

The evolution from custom scripts to no-code solutions has revolutionized how managers can handle routine tasks. Tools like Postman flows have made automation accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background. The key is to identify repetitive patterns in your work and gradually automate them, freeing up time for more impactful activities.

Remember, automation isn't about replacing human judgment – it's about enhancing our capability to focus on what truly matters: leading our teams, making strategic decisions, and driving innovation.
