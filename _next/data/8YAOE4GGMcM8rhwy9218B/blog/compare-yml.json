This library extends the supports to the comparison of deeply nested keys too.\n\n# Motivation\nIn most of the projects, the problems that comes with internationalization `I18n` is not a day to day one. When it  comes, it's a tedious and time consuming one with lot of manual work. Most of the time, developers add the keys in primary language translation file `(en.yml)` and leave the rest of language translations stale.\n\nWhen a customer reports the inconsistencies in the translation, the tedious boring manual work of comparing these keys and finding out which translations are missing for what all languages is trusted into the hands of an unlucky developer by the Product Manager. This tool is a way to escape those situations with a bunch of commands and to enjoy rest of your day in peace.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'compare-yml'\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    bundle install\n\nAlternatively, you can just run the following in the terminal:\n\n    gem install compare-yml\n\nThis should install compare-yml gem in your system.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe usage of this gem is pretty simple. You don't need to have this in your gemfile to use this. An executable is already included.\n\nSo after doing installing the gem, you can directly type in \n\n```\ncompare_yml source_file target_file\n```\nin your terminal/command-prompt.\n\nThis library is designed to work with comparing both yaml and json files. An example usage in a rails translation situation would be: \n\n```\ncompare_yml config/locales/en.yml config/locales/de.yml\n```\n\nThis will show you the keys which are missing from `en.yml` compared to `de.yml` and vice versa. The comparision is two way meaning, we will compare `en.yml` keys with respect to `de.yml` keys and also compare `de.yml` keys with respect to `en.yml`.\n\nAn example usage for people using translation in react app would be :\n\n```\ncompare_yml locales/fr.json locales/en.json\n```\n\nYou can use this for comparing translation files, as well as for any yml or json files for that matter.
