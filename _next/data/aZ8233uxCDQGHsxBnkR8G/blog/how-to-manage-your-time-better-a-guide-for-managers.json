Rachel keeps some time free each day to handle these things.</p>\n<p>10% Office Work (about 4 hours a week)\nEvery Friday afternoon, Rachel does her expense reports, catches up on emails, and updates her project tracking.

Plan two hours each week just for Box 2 work\n2. Create simple guides to help your team handle common questions\n3. Cut down Box 4 activities by setting aside specific times for email\n4. For Box 1 tasks, have backup plans ready for common problems\n\n### The 40-30-20-10 Way\n\nThis is a simple way to split up your week:\n\n40% Planning Ahead (about 16 hours a week)\nMeet Rachel, who runs marketing at a growing company. She spends her mornings looking at what's working, what isn't, and what to do next.

Group similar tasks together\n3. Let your team handle routine decisions\n4. Keep track of your time for two weeks to see where it really goes\n\n## Practical Ways to Save Time\n\n### Block Your Time\n\nThink of your day like building blocks. Maya, a project manager, sets up her Tuesday like this:\n- 8:30-10:00: Quiet work time (planning)\n- 10:00-10:30: Quick break (catch up on messages)\n- 10:30-12:00: Team meetings\n- 12:00-12:15: Short break\n- 12:15-1:15: Lunch (no work)\n- 1:15-2:45: Work with team\n- 2:45-3:00: Break\n- 3:00-4:00: Office work\n- 4:00-4:30: Wrap up and plan tomorrow\n\nThe secret is leaving small gaps between tasks.

John, an IT manager, made a checklist for new team members. Now everyone knows what to do, and he doesn't need to explain it each time.\n\nGood systems should:\n- Be easy to follow\n- Save time\n- Work without you there\n- Be written down\n\n### Getting Your Team to Help\n\nYour job as a manager isn't to do everything - it's to help your team work well together.\n\nSarah taught her team to:\n- Handle small problems without asking her\n- Make basic decisions on their own\n- Know when to ask for help\n- Share what they learn with each other\n\nThis means Sarah can focus on bigger things while her team handles the day-to-day work.\n\n## Measuring Success\n\nHow do you know if you're managing time better? Look for these signs:\n- You have time to plan ahead\n- Fewer last-minute emergencies\n- Your team can work without asking you about everything\n- You feel less stressed\n- You get important work done most days\n\nRemember: Start small. Pick one thing to improve first. When that feels easy, add something else. Over time, these small changes add up to big improvements.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nGood time management isn't about doing more things - it's about doing the right things. Focus on what matters most, build good habits, and help your team grow. Don't try to be perfect. Just try to be a little better each week.","title":"How to Manage Your Time Better: A Guide for Managers","description":"Managing your time well as a manager comes down to organizing your tasks into important/urgent groups and setting aside specific times for different types of work, like planning ahead (40%), running current projects (30%), handling new things (20%), and office work (10%).
