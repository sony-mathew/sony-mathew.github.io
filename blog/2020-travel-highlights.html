After the first wave came the second and the lockdowns changed the shapes and forms from nation to state to micro containment zones to what not. It was a hibernation period for all of us. We learned a lot about ourselves. We evolved in many ways. Even the coronavirus evolved faster than us!</p>
<p>Hope and peace seemed to be the rarest commodity than ever before. Many of us lost our dearest ones.  We all have our own demons to face. We all fight our own battles, one day at a time.</p>
<p>But then we learned to live with it. Learned to live through it. We started learning new hobbies. We started writing, cooking, singing, dancing, tiktoking, knitting, exercising, reading, playing instruments and what not. Even when some of them were shortlived than others, we tried. Many of us took a break from productive activities and engaged in a barely getting by survival mode coupled with lazyness.</p>
<p>We will go back to the old world one day, where we could travel without boundaries. To the mountains. To the oceans. Listening to waves. Attending a concert. Meeting people. Having a regular coffee chat with real coffee and real people. Relocating. Rediscovering. Atleast sleeping well knowing that we have the freedom to do all this whenever we want to, even if we dont do it. Until then, hold on. Take a break. Enjoy the little things in life. Be mindful. Help the people in need around you. Seek help if you feel like going under. Be patient. Be kind. Stand for what you believe in and always try things that you believe in, that you want to do and try even harder when it slips.</p>
